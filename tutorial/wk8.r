# Content ----

## Boston housing data ----
#First load required packages
library(tidyverse)
Boston <- readRDS('./data/Boston.rds')
Boston


## Factor analysis ----
# factor analysis, four factor, no rotation.
fa <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town') %>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'none',scores = 'none')
names(fa)
fa

#1. What is the loading of the third factor on the variable PTRATIO
loadings(fa)
loadings(fa)["PTRATIO",]
loadings(fa)["PTRATIO",3]
## [1] -0.6802375


#2. What are the unique variance of the variable MEDV and CRIM?
fa$uniquenesses
fa$uniquenesses["MEDV"]
## MEDV
## 0.126886
fa$uniquenesses["CRIM"]
## CRIM
## 0.7086018

#3. Carry out the analysis after standardising the data first. Does your answer to question 2 change?
fa_sc <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town') %>%
  scale %>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'none',scores = 'none')

fa_sc$uniquenesses["MEDV"]
## MEDV
## 0.126886
fa_sc$uniquenesses["CRIM"]
## CRIM
## 0.7086018
# The answer is the same


#4. Why are the answers to 3 and 4 the same/ different?
#The answers are the same since the R function automatically standardises the data. This also implies that
#the total variance of each variable is 1.

#5. In light of all these answers, interpret the uniqueness of MEDV and CRIM and compare these.

#The uniqueness of MEDV is 0.1269 which implies that 12.69% of the variation in median house value cannot
#be explained by factors common to all variables in the analysis.

#The uniqueness of CRIM is 0.7086 which implies that 70.86% of the variation in crime cannot be explained
#by factors common to all variables in the analysis.

#Compared to median house value, a much larger component of crime is idiosyncratic and is not explained by
#factors common to all variables in the analysis.


## Interpreting the factors -----

#1. For each factor identify the loadings that are close to zero and those that are large.
loadings(fa)
#All variables apart from CHAS load onto the first factor with the largest loadings for RAD and TX. All
#variables apart from CHAS, CRIM and TX load onto the second factor with the largest loading for NOX.
#Factors 3 and 4 have similar patterns of loadings.

#2. Carry out the same analysis after doing a varimax rotation.
fa_v <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town') %>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'varimax',scores = 'none')
loadings(fa_v)
# The Varimax rotation has not worked too well since now the first three factors have very few zero loadings.
# This is also difficult to interpret.

#3. Carry out the same analysis after doing a promax rotation.
fa_p <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town') %>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'promax',scores = 'none')
loadings(fa_p)
#The first factor has high loadings for AGE and DIS, these have almost zero loadings for the other factors.
#The loading for ZN is also quite high. The first factor is a geographic factor with higher scores associated
#with older houses close to the city.

#The second factor has high loadings for RAD and TX, these have almost zero loadings for the other factors.
#The second factor is also the only factor that CRIM loads onto. The second factor is a infrastructure
#factor with higher scores associated with higher property taxes and better access to highways.

#The third factor has high loadings for RM and LSTAT and MEDV, these variables only weakly onto the other
#factors. The third factor is a socioeconomic factor with higher values of this factor associated with more
#expensive, larger houses and fewer residents in the low socioeconomic category.

#The fourth factor has high loadings for PTRATIO. The variable ZN also loads heavily onto the fourth factor,
#but not as much as it does for the fourth factor. The fourth factor is possibly a education factor with higher
#values of this factor associated with less investment in education (i.e. too many students per teacher).


## Factor Scores -----
#1. Estimate the factor scores using Bartlettâ€™s method when there is no rotation.
fa_b <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town') %>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'none',scores = 'Bartlett')

#2. Estimate the correlation matrix of the factors.
round(cor(fa_b$scores), 3)
## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 Factor4
## Factor1 1.000000e+00 2.475727e-16 2.327100e-16 -9.611535e-16
## Factor2 2.475727e-16 1.000000e+00 -4.600106e-16 6.173985e-16
## Factor3 2.327100e-16 -4.600106e-16 1.000000e+00 3.159798e-16
## Factor4 -9.611535e-16 6.173985e-16 3.159798e-16 1.000000e+00

#3. Repeat the previous 2 questions using the promax rotation
fa_p <- Boston %>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>%
  factanal(factors = 4,rotation = 'promax',scores = 'Bartlett')
cor(fa_p$scores)
## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 Factor4
## Factor1 1.0000000 0.5308492 -0.5220026 0.1532655
## Factor2 0.5308492 1.0000000 -0.4866319 0.2649672
## Factor3 -0.5220026 -0.4866319 1.0000000 -0.2319996
## Factor4 0.1532655 0.2649672 -0.2319996 1.0000000

#4. Are these answers what you expect? Why or why not?
#These answers are as expected. The unrotated factor scores have a correlation matrix that is almost an identity
#matrix. This implies the factors are uncorrelated. The promax rotation induces correlation in the factors.


## PCA v Factor Analysis -----

#How does factor analysis (FA) differ from PCA?

#PCA assumes no model (or structure). The objective is simply to identify linear combinations of variables
#that explain the maximum amount of variance. The principal component are uncorrelated with each other and
#are not necessarily interpretable. PCA can at most be seen as a crude starting point for EFA. Factor analysis
#is built around a statistical model. There is a component of variance that is idiosyncratic to each variable and
#is unexplained by the other variables. Although uncorrelated factors are often assumed this assumption can be
#relaxed. Factor analysis is much more concerned with interpretation of factors.
